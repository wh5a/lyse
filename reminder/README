Source code for "Designing a Concurrent Application". The layout
follows the standard OTP Design Principles.

The ebin/ directory is where files will go once they are compiled. The
include/ directory is used to store .hrl files that are to be included
by other applications; the private .hrl files are usually just kept
inside the src/ directory. The priv/ directory is used for executables
that might have to interact with Erlang, such as specific drivers and
whatnot. Then the last one is the src/ directory, where all .erl files
stay.

In standard Erlang projects, this directory structure can vary a
little. A conf/ directory can be added for specific configuration
files, doc/ for documentation and lib/ for third party libraries
required for your application to run.

By going in your command line and running erl -make, the files should
all be compiled and put inside the ebin/ directory for you. Start the
Erlang shell by doing erl -pa ebin/. The -pa <directory> option tells
the Erlang VM to add that path to the places it can look in for
modules.

Another option is to start the shell as usual and call
make:all([load]). This will look for a file named 'Emakefile' in the
current directory, recompile it (if it changed) and load the new
files.
